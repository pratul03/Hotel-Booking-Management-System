# Hotel-Booking-Management-System
Hotel Booking Management Web Application
Welcome to the Hotel Booking Management Web Application! This application provides a platform for managing hotel bookings efficiently. It's built with Spring Boot for the backend, utilizing Spring Security for authentication and JWT for token-based authorization. MySQL is used as the database for storing application data. On the frontend, React is employed to create a dynamic user interface, with Bootstrap used for styling to ensure a clean and responsive design.

Features
User Authentication: Secure user authentication is implemented using Spring Security. Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.

JWT Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for stateless authentication. This ensures secure communication between the frontend and backend, providing a seamless user experience.

Hotel Booking Management: Users can browse available hotels, view details, and make bookings. The application provides an intuitive interface for managing bookings efficiently.

Responsive Design: Bootstrap is used for frontend design, ensuring that the application is responsive and accessible across various devices and screen sizes.
